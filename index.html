        <p class="lead mb-4">I was in the IB program from 7th to 12th grade. There were many requirements to be a part of the program and they only increased as the grade level you were in increased. I had to complete many community service, action, and creativity hours. They were training us to have good time management skills and be well-rounded students. My years in the program taught me a lot about hard-work and determination. When times got difficult, I still managed to pull through and get my work done. As a teenager, it was difficult to have so much pressure on you, but I am so grateful for my time there. It gave me a whole different perspective in life and allowed me to grow as a person.<br><br>
        Growing on my community service hours that were required, I spent most of my time at the Corona Public Library where I tutored children grades K-6. My experience there got interesting when the state of California integrated the new common core criteria. The ways children were learning were far different from the ways I had learned, so I had to adapt and become familiar with the changes. It was challenging, but in the end, I was able to help them get their work done. Not only did I tutor children, but I also supervised them during movie nights. I was the only volunteer during those nights and with so many children it got a little rowdy. Still, I managed to keep everything under control.<br><br>
        I played soccer for about 8 years. I kept moving from team to team because the league I was in worked that way. In 2017 I was asked to join the select team which was filled with girls that had good experience playing the sport. Initially, I would sit at the bench because I was new to the team and only played when the main players needed breaks. However, that was soon over, and I was starting at every game. It did not matter where the coach put me, I would always try my hardest because I wanted to do anything to benefit the team. That eventually paid off since the coach made me co-captain for two seasons. I was able to make suggestions for team and given extra responsibilities to get the girls warmed-up.<br><br>
        For my creativity hours in IB, a group of friends and I decided to go Christmas caroling at a hospice center and bake them cookies. None of us were good singers nor good at baking, but we really tried. The people at the center were so incredibly cheerful and it was heart-warming seeing them sing along to the carols. The experience taught us to get out of our comfort zone and create new experiences. Not only that, but working in a group can be stressful, but we all made sure to do our part and make it to all the meetings. It truly benefited us in the end, and we made other people very happy.
